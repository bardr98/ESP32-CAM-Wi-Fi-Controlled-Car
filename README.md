# esp32-cam-Car
The project involved utilizing the ESP32-CAM board with Arduino to create a remote-controlled car. The car was designed to be controlled using a phone or computer through a Wi-Fi connection. By integrating the ESP32-CAM module, the car was able to stream live video footage to the controlling device while simultaneously receiving commands for movement. The Arduino code enabled the communication between the ESP32-CAM and the controlling device, allowing users to wirelessly drive the car and view its surroundings in real-time through a user-friendly interface.
